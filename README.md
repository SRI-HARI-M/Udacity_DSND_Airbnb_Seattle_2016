## Installation

In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on **anaconda distribution 4.5.11** in combination with **python 3.6.6**. The scripts don't require additional python libraries.

## Project motivation
As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Term 2 project to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. The Students were to pick a dataset, come up with some questions and answer those questions through a blogpost. I wanted to identify useful patterns and information for people who want to make their house more attractable to rent through AirBnB.

## File descriptions

The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted, A .pdf of the Blogpost, Udacity Rubric as .pdf,
A folder with the raw data and this readme file.

## Udacity Rubric

The project has satisfied all the requirements mentioned in the rubric. CRISP-DM techniques are used in answering the questions.

## Summary

Questions I chose from the Provided Seattle Airbnb data of 2016 are:
1.Get good price on Airbnb?
2.Get good reviews on Airbnb?
3.Using ML to create better predicting Model?
The project has followed the CRISP-DM methods. 
I used Inferential statistics such as bar graphs, histograms and 2D plots in helping to visualize and clean data. 
For Question 1, Since the requirement doesn't needed a ML technique, I used a heatmap to visuzlize and answer the question.
For Question 2, Since the requirement doesn't needed a ML technique, I used a heatmap to visuzlize and answer the question.
For Question 3, different ML techniques were used and the best one with good r2 score was chosen to answer the question.

## Results
I found that the main driver for prices are how many people a listing can accommodate. Location is also very important aswell as aminities
such as TV, parking, Internet and air condition.Tourist prefer to rent an entire house over a private room and a shared room. Having a strict cancellation policy leads to reduced interest of clients. Seattle is the most popular around the turn of the year.
