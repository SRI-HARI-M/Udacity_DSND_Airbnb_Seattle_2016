## Installation

In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on **anaconda distribution 4.5.11** in combination with **python 3.6.6**. The scripts don't require additional python libraries.

## Project motivation
As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Term 2 project to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. The Students were to pick a dataset, come up with some questions and answer those questions through a blogpost. I wanted to identify useful patterns and information for people who want to make their house more attractable to rent through AirBnB.

## File descriptions

The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted,
A folder with the raw data and this readme file.

## Results
I found that the main driver for prices are how many people a listing can accommodate. Location is also very important aswell as aminities
such as TV, parking, Internet and air condition.Tourist prefer to rent an entire house over a private room and a shared room. Having a strict cancellation policy leads to reduced interest of clients. Seattle is the most popular around the turn of the year.
